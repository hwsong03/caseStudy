                <h3>Week One</h3>
                <p>This week was focused on creating the basic shapes: a simple desk and a chair as an introduction to working with Maya.</p>

            <h2>Textures Used</h2>
            <p>The textures are hand-painted in Adobe Photoshop using a stamp tool for authenticity, based on the original works of Van Gogh.</p>

            <h2>Tools and Software</h2>
            <p>Maya was the primary tool for creating the 3D space, which was a new and exciting challenge. Adobe Photoshop provided the means for texture creation, which I then edited with various tools to refine the final look.</p>
